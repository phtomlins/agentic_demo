This fast-scaling SaaS business is building technology to help organisations make smarter, fairer workforce decisions. They are now looking for a VP of AI & Machine Learning to lead the evolution of their AI capabilities and shape the intelligence behind their platform.

This is a hands-on leadership role: you’ll set the AI strategy, design and scale production NLP and machine learning systems, and grow a high-performing ML team - while closely partnering with Product and Engineering to deliver real, measurable impact for customers.

This VP of AI & Machine Learning will

- Take ownership of the company’s AI roadmap — from concept to production.

- Build and scale NLP and ML models that turn complex organisational data into meaningful insights.

- Lead and develop a small ML engineering team, acting as a player-coach.

- Establish MLOps, monitoring, governance, and responsible AI practices.

- Work cross-functionally with Product, Engineering, and Customer teams.

- Represent AI and technology thinking to customers, partners, and the leadership team.

What this VP of AI & Machine Learning will bring:

- Deep experience in NLP / LLMs / semantic search / embeddings

- Proven ability to design, deploy, and scale machine learning systems in production.

- Strong knowledge of MLOps (model versioning, monitoring, evaluation, drift detection).

- Hands-on expertise in Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, HuggingFace, and vector search technologies.

- Experience leading or mentoring small, senior ML/data teams.

- Ability to translate technical work into clear product and business value.

- A pragmatic, delivery-focused mindset — comfortable in fast-moving, evolving environments.

The tech environment:

- Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, HuggingFace Transformers

- Semantic search / Embeddings / Vector DBs (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate)

- ML Ops tools (MLflow / Weights & Biases)

- AWS / Docker / Kubernetes
