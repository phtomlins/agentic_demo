I do my own maintenance - just changed the gearbox and clutch on my wife's hyundai i10 on the drive. In fact, I've never used a garage mechanic because I can always to the work myself. I used my skills in analytics to diagnose a sticking throttle body based on the logged data from the obd reader. Obviously the job doesn't require this - but I am very unique in this sense, I doubt they will get another analytics director with my hands-on passion for working on cars.

Cycling, zwift, running. I used to take part in sprint triathlons until I injured my shoulder.
