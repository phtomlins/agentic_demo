Additional Information and Prompts:

What about my ability to zoom in to details, and zoom out to the big picture. It's a core skill - maybe we can weave this into an achivement?



Also, at Caristo I have made us religiously data centred and data led. I have built a data science platform to give us data insights.



A concrete example is the coronary plaque SaaS that I led the design and build of. This was data led from the ground up. We built it because the data said there was a market that we were missing. My analytics platform gave us turn around times, which gives us the cost of service delivery. This enabled focussed research to optimise margin per sale. My data science platform has enabled us to gain insights for marketing, understaning typical LTV in the UK and US (they are different). In fact, the plaque product was developed because it drives LTV for US customers in lieu of FDA clearance for our core inflammation product.



I have built predictive models for forecasting churn risk to help us understand the market that we are operating in.


My key strength is my ability to zoom out to see the big picture across commercial, marketing, sales, product, research, customers, operations, and then zoom in to specific details to solve the business need without getting lost in the weeds.

I am biased towards fast delivery, over code quality. My skill is in figuring out what the requirements actually are, then turning that into some kind of quantifiable metric so that tech teams (data/ML/product engineering) know what good enough looks like.

What I've done with my own teams is get models and analysis shared really early - I get the person who is prototyping to pass on what they have done really early - at the point where the individual is saying 'it's not ready yet'... or it just needs a bit more work. I make them pass it on to another team member to try out. More often than not, the model works well enough for the intended purpose - so we can move really really quickly.

I've also found back door ways to integrate into product - often by exploiting the REST API to automate a function. Whilst this goes against the engineering preference or how the architect has designed the system, it allows us to move fast and meet customers needs.

My primary observation is that investors or prospective buyers of our company, or customers are not buying beautiful code or perfect ML models. They actually don't care how scrappy it is behind the scenes. What they care about is if it meets their requirements.


That doesn't mean that I do not care about maintainability or well structured code. I do. But, my zoom in zoom out skill enables me to judge very effectively what good enough looks like and how to make pragmatic choices that favour business success.

My current role focuses on designing radiotranscriptomic risk scores for cardiac outcomes (major adverse cardiac events). Radiotranscriptomics is defined by linking image derived biomarkers to RNA sequencing bioinformatic datasets. Not only have a bought this to market in the EU, I designed and executed an FDA de novo study which is currently in review. This was the result of several years of consultation with the FDA.
