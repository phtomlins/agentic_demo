You will find individual job descriptions in associated folders under the ./application-packs folder. Use the "Job Description.md" file in each sub-folder as the basis for a CV and cover letter. If there is no job description then you can skip that folder.

I will build source information in the ./Source directory. Read the files in there and take them as the source of truth from which my CV can be built. You can sell my skills and experience in the language used in the job description for a specific job, but you must not hallucinate. The CVs and cover letters must be entirely factually true - even if they are framed in the best possible way to align my skills and experience with the advert. Additionally use my reference CVs to glean key information. These are called Ref_CVn.md, where 'n' denotes a number.

When you have finished, then critque the documents as a hiring manager. You have little time and dislike screening applicants. You have many applicants who are not qualified. You have some who are a safe fit from a similar company with exactly the background you were thinking of when you wrote the JD. You automatically gravitate to them and find them quick and easy to put into the 'interview' pile.

Then you see my CV. Critique against these other, perfect, candidates and the JD. Do I make it to the pile of candidate you want to speak to, or am I just another unqualified candidate?

Once you have performed you critique, rework the CV and cover letters in light of your own criticism. I need to be the preferred candidate. How do you make that happen?

Then critique as an executive search recruiter. Rework the CV based upon that feedback, taking into account knowledge from the hiring manager critique.

Create the following outputs:
1. CV
2. 1 Page quick skim CV
3. Cover Letter
4. 90 Day plan in the role
5. Combined Cover Letter and CV for use in LinkedIn Easy Apply.

Avoid using typical LLM phrasing and sentence structure. Especially sentences with hyphenated sub-sentences embedded within them. These are tell-tale signs that AI has helped. These documents must read as entirely human generated. You need to fool the ATS and AI detector into thinking this is all human output. You need to convince the human hiring manager that it is written by me.

Use my tone. Act as the ATS and LLM detector. Can you tell that this is LLM output? If so, re-work until you think it has been written by a human.

Prioritise ATS performance. It still needs to get to the top of the pile.

Generate output in both .docx format and PDF.

For each role that yo uhave generated an application pack for, generate a 2 minute pitch that I can give if I get a phone call - normally the recruiter asks tell me about your background. I need to get this down to something really concise and focussed for each role. It needs to sounds natural and like me when spoken - not like a memorised script from AI.

One you have generated it, then read it back to yourself as the recruiter or hiring manager and critique whether you want to move forward with this person. They aren't a perfect fit anyway and you have spoken with a safe bet. 

Having played this back and given a critique, then modify the pitch taking into account your critique.

I looked at the CV. For a Full CV this only covers a couple of jobs and roles. This does not look like an executive worth £200k per year. You aren't applying enough critique. You need to highlight the depth and breadth of my experience across roles.

Look at the generated CV. Compare it to the example CVs in ./example_cvs. How do I stack up compared to these other real people who secured interviews?

Revise to make sure I am competitive whilst keeping the information factual.

Look at the salary which will be £120k to £200k. Does this look like the CV of a person worth that value? If not, critique and revise. I am already at £120k. I am worth a lot more. Make me stand out in that field.

Make sure the final CV and cover letter address all of the criques. The cover letter MUST fit on one side of A4. Remember, no recruiter or hiring manager wants to read pages of text. If that's what they see, my application goes in the rubbish bin.

Also consider whether it is professionally appropriate to add headings like "Why I am a good fit for this role", "Why I’m the right fit", "What I bring beyond the technical requirements", "What excites me about this opportunity" etc. This seem a bit tacky and obviously AI generated. If you have done this sort of thing, as the hiring manager and recruiter, ask youself if this helps me get an interview or not. Make any revisions now!
